The single most powerful way to upgrade your OpenClaw right now is it set up a Mission Control with it.

A Mission Control is a custom OpenClaw generated app that allows you to track what your OpenClaw does, create custom tooling for it, and significantly upgrade its memory.

It's a custom experience that transforms as you use your OpenClaw. And the best part is, you don't have to code it. Your OpenClaw does.

In this article I'll go over every tool in my Mission Control and include a prompt to build it out yourself. Feel free to take any of these tools and build them out for your Mission Control. Or better yet, use this as inspiration to build your own custom Mission Control.

(As a sidenote: everything in this mission control is built with NextJS with a Convex database. Make sure to mention that to your Claw when you initially set this up.)

## Tasks Board

The first tool in my Mission Control is a tasks board. This allows me to see exactly what my OpenClaw Henry is working on at any given time. It also more important allows Henry to see what I'm working on.

Sometimes I wake up and Henry takes some tasks off my plate and completes them for me. This tool is CRITICAL for getting your OpenClaw to act proactively.

Prompt: Please build a task board for us that tracks all the tasks we are working on. I should be able to see the status of every task and who the task is assigned to, me or you. Moving forward please put all tasks you work on into this board and update it in real time.

## Content Pipeline

If you are a content creator (which you should be. Distribution is the last moat), you need a content pipeline tool in your mission control.

Whenever I think of ideas for videos, I quickly put it in the idea column. Then once per day, Henry goes and writes the script for the video, moves the content to Thumbnail, uses a local image model to generate the thumbnail, then moves it to 'filming' so I can film the video.

This is fantastic for automating a lot of your content.

Prompt: Please build me a content pipeline tool. I want it to have every stage of content creation in it. I should be able to edit ideas and put full scripts in it and attach images if need be. I want you to manage this pipeline with me and add wherever you can.

## Calendar

This is the most important component if you want your OpenClaw to be proactive. The calendar allows you to see what scheduled tasks your OpenClaw has coming up.

I hear a lot of complaints that people's OpenClaws aren't doing work proactively or aren't doing scheduled tasks. This component allows you to confirm your Claw has scheduled it's tasks properly.

Prompt: Please build a calendar for us in the mission control. All your scheduled tasks and cron jobs should live here. Anytime I have you schedule a task, put it in the calendar so I can ensure you are doing them correctly.

## Memory

The memory screen is my favorite screen. It's basically a log of my entire digital life. It also dramatically improves OpenClaw's memory system.

The memory screen allows you to view every memory your Claw has every created. Instead of them all being hidden in markdown files in your computer, you can now view them in this beautiful UI.

Also critical to build a global search here so that you can search through old memories and conversations to see what you discussed in the past.

Prompt: Please build a memory screen in our mission control. It should list all your memories in beautiful documents. We should also have a search component so I can quickly search through all our memories.

## Team

The Team screen is great for building your digital organization. I truly believe the best way to get the most out of OpenClaw is treat it like an actual company and your agents as employees.

This will also hold your Claw accountable for spinning up the right agents and maintaining the right memories for each.

Think about what tasks you regularly do, then create agents for each. Give each distinct roles and responsibilities. This will make your work so much more efficient and powerful.

Prompt: Please build me a team structure screen. It should show you, plus all the subagents you regularly spin up to do work. If you haven't thought about which sub agents you spin up, please create them and organize them by roles and responsibilities. This should be developers, writers, and designers as examples.

## Office

I have to be honest, the office view is mostly for fun, but it's still helpful in a few ways. It allows you to see exactly what your agents are working on at any given time. It's also great for making sure you're getting maximum efficiency out of your team. If you see them standing around, you can give them orders to put them to work.

Prompt: Please build me a digital office screen where I can view each agent working. They should be represented by individual avatars and have their own work areas and computers. When they are working they should be at their computer. I should be able to quickly view the status of every team member.

## Conclusion

Feel free to steal any of these prompts, or even better yet, copy the screenshot and give it to your OpenClaw. The most powerful way to create your Mission Control though is to make it custom for your and your workflows.

Ask your OpenClaw what mission control components you can build that would make your work more efficient and better. Then as you work with your Claw, you can add more components as you go.

Most importantly: just enjoy it. Have fun. Not everything you do needs to be in an effort to optimize. Treat this as much of an art form as an optimization exercise. You're allowed to have fun when playing with AI!
